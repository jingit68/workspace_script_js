Generating a new SSH key

1 Open Terminal.

2 Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
	This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.

	> Generating public/private rsa key pair.
3 When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

	> Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]

4 At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases".

	> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
	> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]


Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent
Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key. When adding your SSH key to the agent, use the default macOS ssh-add command, and not an application installed by macports, homebrew, or some other external source.

1 Start the ssh-agent in the background.

	$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	> Agent pid 59566

2 (no need)If you're using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.

	Host *
  	  AddKeysToAgent yes
          UseKeychain yes
           IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

3 Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.

	$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
	Note: The -K option is Apple's standard version of ssh-add, which stores the passphrase in your keychain for you when you add an ssh key to the ssh-agent.

	If you don't have Apple's standard version installed, you may receive an error. For more information on resolving this error, see "Error: ssh-add: illegal option -- K."

4 Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.
	$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard
	
	https://github.com/settings/keys (after you login)
	find "SSH and GPG keys"
	add new sshkey
	paste the key
